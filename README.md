# C--Console-application-for-small-task

Develop a C# console application to find which integer between a range of integers of your choice has the maximum number of divisors and which numbers are the prime numbers.
▪ Your program should read the range of integers (E.g. 20-40, 1-25 etc. )
▪ It should display the results i.e. prime numbers in the range and the number which has the highest
number of divisors.
▪ It is possible that several integers in this range have the same, maximum number of divisors. Your
program only has to display one of them.
